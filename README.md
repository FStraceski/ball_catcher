NOTE: This setup uses an EV3, Raspberry Pi 3b+, and a laptop with a camera

Due to not having a serial adapter available for my PC. Serial communications
are sent over bluetooth to the bluetooth virtual serial port on the raspberry pi
A small script on the raspberry pi relays everything in the bluetooth port out
through the GPIO serial pins on the pi, and into the EV3.a
